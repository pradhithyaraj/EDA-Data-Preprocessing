# EDA & Data Preprocessing

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Preprocessing** on a real-world dataset. The goal is to clean and transform raw data into a structured and machine-learning-ready format by handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
